# Amy's Projects
> This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website. I don't have any projects to add yet, so instead included links to my video work until I can get some projects up there.

## Media

- Most of the photos on the site as of 9/27 from my film/video projects, the last photo of the cowboys is from a hot tub ad that ran in Architectural Digest in the 80's. I love that picture.

-I look forward to adding portfolio projects as I continue learning! When I do, the site will be less focused on my film and video work, but I wanted to have some strong imagery for now.
